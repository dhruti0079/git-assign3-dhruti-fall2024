# Learn Git Branching - Key Takeaways

## 1. Introduction to Git
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) that tracks changes, enabling collaboration and robust branching.

## 2. Basic Commands
git init: Initialize a new repository.
git add: Stage changes for commit.
git commit: Save changes with a message.
git status: Check the status of your repo.
git log: View the commit history.

## 3. Branching and Merging
Branches: Enable parallel development. Use git branch <branch-name> to create and git checkout <branch-name> to switch.
Merging: Combines changes from different branches.
Fast-Forward: Simple pointer move.
Three-Way Merge: Combines diverged branches.
Conflict Resolution: Required for conflicting changes.

## 4. Rebasing
Rebase: Reapplies commits on a new base for a linear history.

## 5. Working with Remotes
Clone: Copy a remote repository (git clone <url>).
Fetch: Retrieve updates without merging.
Pull: Fetch and merge updates.
Push: Upload commits to the remote.

## 6. Advanced Topics
Cherry-Picking: Apply changes from a specific commit.
Stashing: Temporarily save uncommitted work.
Tags: Label commits, e.g., for releases.
